[1] [“A Government Decision Analytics Framework Based on Citizen Opinion”] (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2910093&CFID=799242938&CFTOKEN=37955034)

```
This ongoing research aims to develop a Government Decision Support Framework that employs citizen opinions and sentiments to predict the level of acceptance of newly proposed policies. The system relies on a knowledge base of citizen opinions and an Ontological Model comprising aspects and related terms of different policy domains as an input and a Bayesian predictive procedure. The work proceeds in four basic steps. The first step involves developing domain models comprising aspects for different policy domains in government and automatically acquiring semantically related terms for these aspects from associated policy documents. The second step involves computing citizen sentiments and opinions for the different policy aspects. The third involves updating the ontology with the computed sentiments and the last step involves employing a Bayesian Predictive Process to predict likely citizen opinion for a new proposal (policy) based on information available in the ontology. We provide some background to this work, describe our approach in some detail and discuss the progress made.

[2] [“A Propsed Government Decision Support System Based on Citizen Interactions over Social Networks”]: /publications/A Propsed Government Decision Support System Based on Citizen Interactions over Social Networks.pdf


```
This research proposes a Government Support Framework That analyze governmental policies (Introduced or Under discussions) and produce citizens’ satisfaction rates (Real-time and Predicted) towards the policy and its Aspects by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques and Knowledge Management Processes for Citizens’ e participation. Citizen to Government (C2G) interactions are analyzed to give insights to decision makers. The framework proposes the application of NLP, opinion mining and Data Mining algorithms to extract knowledge and produce predictions using Bayes Statistical Theorem over Keyword co-occurrences and sentiment analysis results to be presented through a simple dashboard Interface for unexperienced users. The produced system is a government support system that will finally lead to the inclusion of citizen satisfaction as a variable when making citizen related decisions for obtaining higher citizen satisfaction, citizen empowerment and inclusion.

Citizens’ satisfaction index towards public policies is a core political research question. Seeking agile and efficient public policies, public policy makers are perpetually investigating how to measure citizens’ satisfaction towards their policies, in order to overhaul faulty public policy aspects or topics that outcome a negative citizens’ satisfaction index. Bearing in mind that a correct calculation will grant a significant success for the public policy and the public policy makers. Our perspective is that nevertheless the index was well calculated or not it is always too late, public policy is already issued and citizen reactions are ensue. Hence, we previously proposed a public policy satisfaction prediction framework. This framework reckons on a knowledge base that allows formulating the prediction formulae. To develop this knowledge base we extend the Core Public Policy Vocabulary (CPPV), apply Named Entity Recognition and Topic Modeling, in parallel, for keywords extraction and semantic similarity measuring in order to relate the detected keywords with the pre-defined public policy aspects. The aforementioned methods will allow an automated population of the prediction knowledge base.

[4] [“Towards a Vocabulary for Open Public Policies”]: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3047366

```
Despite the large volume of policies and other formal decision instruments in government and international organizations, policy repositories with rich metadata across government and public administration jurisdictions are virtually nonexistent. The lack of such infrastructure and technical resources makes learning within government, across political and economic regions (such as the EU) and cross-border learning challenging. The use of open standards such as the European Union Interoperability Solutions for Public Administrations (ISA) Core vocabularies for describing government policies could enable the development of robust intra and inter-government policy indexing and search infrastructure. This poster describes a policy vocabulary developed through the systematic and detailed analysis of policy documents spanning several sectors. We present the conceptual model for the vocabulary and describe its major classes.

[5] [“Standardising Public Policy Documentation to foster Collaboration across Government Agencies”] /publications/CPPV.pdf

```
Public policies documents convey strategic directions and framework of actions of government in a particular sector. For most societal challenges, there is a need for government entities at the same and different levels to coordinate their policies and collaborate on the implementations of policies. However, this coordination and collaboration efforts are seriously hampered by the lack of a central repository for public policy documents from which policy makers and researchers can access related policies on a particular topic, industry or group of stakeholders. To address this challenge, this paper describes the development of Vocabulary to underpin the implementation of a shared public policy repository in Europe. The Core Public Policy Vocabulary (CPPV) is developed as a semantic interoperability resource for government organizations for consistent description and documentation of public policies to enable efficient discovery, cross-referencing and analysis of policy documents. We describe our approach, conceptual model, elements of the vocabulary, its implementation and concrete scenarios for the use of the vocabulary.

[6][“Mining Governmental Collaboration through Semantic Profiling of Open Data Catalogues and Publishers”] 

```
Due to the increasing adoption of open data among governments worldwide especially in the European Union area, a deeper analysis of the newly published data is becoming a mandate. Apart from analyzing the published dataset itself we aimed on analyzing published dataset catalogues. A dataset catalogue or a dataset metadata contains features that describe what the data is about in a textual representation. So, we first acquire data from open data portals, choose descriptive dataset catalogue features, and then construct an aggregated textual representation of the datasets. Afterwards we enrich those textual representations using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to create a new comparable data feature “Named Entities”. By mining the new data feature we are able to produce datasets and publishers relatedness network. Those networks are used to point similarities between the published data across multiple open data portals. Pointing all possible collaborations for integrating and standardizing data features and types would increase the value of da1ta and ease its analysis process.
